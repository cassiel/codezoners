# WEEK 24: CLOJURE

- Follow the ClojureScript/Light Table [basic tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial/blob/master/lt-cljs-tutorial.cljs) to get used to ClojureScript in Light Table. (You need to have a file with extension `.cljs`; checkout the project above to work through the example file.)

- Some basic static page make-up: [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup). See the `hiccup-basic` project here (which can be opened in Light Table).

- Now things get more complicated (as we start getting into Om in ClojureScript): follow the [basic tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Basic-Tutorial) for Om.

# WEEK 21: GLASTONBURY PIE

We're looking at pie charts, and whether we can plot the Glastonbury timetable as a series of "doughnuts".

- [Pie layouts in D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Pie-Layout)
- Example: [Donut Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193) from CSV data

We've ported this example to CoffeeScript and tidied up the layout a bit: see the `glasto-pie` directory.

We'll need to start understanding SQL dates and times (or, at least, how SQLite handles them). Documentation [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_date_time.htm).
